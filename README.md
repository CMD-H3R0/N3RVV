N3RVV: Cognitive Infrastructure for High-Performance Minds

N3RVV, crafted by Justin LaWarre, is a groundbreaking framework to harness fleeting thoughts, especially for neurodivergent minds. The .spo (Spark Portable Object) format, an open YAML-based system, captures, routes, and aligns ideas with AI to transform mental chaos into clarity.

Manifesto:
N3RVV empowers individuals by turning scattered thoughts into actionable Sparks, prioritizing neurodivergent needs. The .spo format bridges human cognition and AI, fostering a scalable infrastructure for innovation. Join us to shape this human-AI synergy.

Usage
specs/spo-schema.yaml: Outlines the .spo format with fields like spark_id, title, summary, and LLM feedback (e.g., clarity_rating).
examples/: Features sample Sparks, such as spark_cert_plan.spo for PMP tracking.
docs/n3rvv_whitepaper_v1.5.pdf: Details N3RVVâ€™s vision and roadmap.
