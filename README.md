âš¡ N3RVV: Cognitive Infrastructure for High-Performance Minds

N3RVV, crafted by Justin LaWarre, is a tactical framework to capture and evolve fleeting thoughts into structured, actionable memory units called Sparks. Designed for high performers and neurodivergent minds, N3RVV introduces the .spo (Spark Portable Object) format â€” an open, YAML-based schema that enables cognition capture, routing, and alignment with AI.

ðŸš€ Why N3RVV?

Turns scattered ideas into actionable Sparks

Bridges human cognition with AI

Provides sovereign, encrypted memory objects under user control

Designed for scalable, open innovation
